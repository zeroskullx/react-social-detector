## üîç Adding Detection Patterns

### Pattern structure

```typescript
export const PLATFORM_PATTERNS: SocialNetworkPattern = {
  name: "Platform Name",
  domains: ["example.com", "www.example.com"],
  patterns: [
    /^https?:\/\/(www\.)?example\.com\/user\/[\w.-]+$/i,
    /^https?:\/\/(www\.)?example\.com\/profile\/[\w.-]+$/i,
  ],
  examples: [
    "https://example.com/user/username",
    "https://www.example.com/profile/userprofile",
  ],
};
```

### Testing patterns

```typescript
describe("Platform Name detection", () => {
  it("should detect valid Platform Name URLs", () => {
    const urls = [
      "https://example.com/user/testuser",
      "https://www.example.com/profile/testprofile",
    ];

    urls.forEach((url) => {
      expect(quickReactSocialDetector(url)?.name).toBe("Platform Name");
    });
  });

  it("should not detect invalid URLs", () => {
    const invalidUrls = ["https://example.com", "https://example.com/invalid"];

    invalidUrls.forEach((url) => {
      expect(quickReactSocialDetector(url)).toBeNull();
    });
  });
});
```
